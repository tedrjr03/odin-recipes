            Sashimi is slices of fresh raw fish (sometimes, meat) presented with several types of garnishes. The quality of sashimi lies in the freshness of fish, the way it’s sliced, presented and garnished. Common garnishes include shredded daikon radish, shiso leaves, or toasted nori (sea weed).
            
            Both nigiri and sashimi are accompanied with pickled ginger and wasabi with soy sauce.</p>



    <h3>Ingrediants</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>Japanese short-grain rice</li>
    <li>Japanese rice vinegar</li>
    <li>Salt and sugar</li>
    <li>Salmon</li>
    <li>Wasabi</li>
    </ul>


    
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
    <li>Put all the Tare ingredients in a small saucepan and bring it to a boil. Bring the heat down and simmer gently until the liquid reduces to about half of the original quantity.</li>
    <li>Put the Sushi Rice Vinegar ingredients in a bowl and mix well until the sugar is dissolved.</li>
    <li>Sprinkle the Sushi Rice Vinegar over the hot rice in a bowl and mix using a spatula. Move the spatula in a cutting motion so that you don’t break the rice grains. Cover the bowl with a wet kitchen towel/kitchen paper.</li>
    <li>Slice the salmon fillets into 3-5mm / ⅛-3⁄16" thick pieces using the sogi-giri (slant cutting) method. Each slice should be about 3cm / 1¼" wide, 8cm / 3⅛" long (note 4).</li>
    <li>Mix the Tezu ingredients in a small bowl.</li>
    </ol>
